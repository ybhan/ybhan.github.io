A musical instrument recognition model for isolated notes and solo phrases. First, Use **MATLAB** to extract acoustic features by Gammatone filtering. Then perform Voice Activity Detection to separate notes in solo phrases. Finally, Use **PyTorch** to build a 2-level CNN classifier based on Hornbostelâ€“Sachs system. The .mat files **MATLAB** produces are further read by **Python** with the help of **SciPy**, which accomplishes the interface between two programming languages.
