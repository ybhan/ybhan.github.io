Use **Python** and **OpenCV** to generate a cylindrical panoramic image from an all-around video. Techniques include:

- Key frame selection
- SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) Matching
- RANSAC (Random Sample Consens)
- Cylindrical Projection
- Image Blending (Linear, Laplacian)
- Image Cropping

The project report written by **LaTeX** is available [here](https://github.com/ybhan/Panoramic-Photo-Generation/blob/master/Panoramic-Photo-Generation.pdf).
