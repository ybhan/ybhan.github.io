This is a responsive **Node.js** web app for detecting human faces in pictures. Sticking with **ES6**, the front end is built with **React.js**, and the back end is supported by **Express.js**. Clarifai API powers the functionality of face detection. There is also a login system to track the number of picture entries per user through **PostgreSQL**. And bcrypt hashing secures the password entered. Deployed on Heroku.
