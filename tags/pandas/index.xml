      <description>Apply both Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms to extract logical rules for mushroom edibility. Firstly use NumPy and Pandas to assign continuous variables into discrete one-hot representation. The Neural Network is implemented by PyTorch. It involves an auxiliary cost function term to force weights to approach Â±1 or 0, so the network can be interpreted as a tree-like logic graph. For the second approach, GA cooperates with Decision Tree, where the accuracy of Decision Tree built by GA selected features serves back as the GA fitness function.</description>
