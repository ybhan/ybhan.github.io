      <description>Apply both Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms to extract logical rules for mushroom edibility. Firstly use NumPy and Pandas to assign continuous variables into discrete one-hot representation. The Neural Network is implemented by PyTorch. It involves an auxiliary cost function term to force weights to approach ±1 or 0, so the network can be interpreted as a tree-like logic graph. For the second approach, GA cooperates with Decision Tree, where the accuracy of Decision Tree built by GA selected features serves back as the GA fitness function.</description>

      <description>A musical instrument recognition model for isolated notes and solo phrases. First, Use MATLAB to extract acoustic features by Gammatone filtering. Then perform Voice Activity Detection to separate notes in solo phrases. Finally, Use PyTorch to build a 2-level CNN classifier based on Hornbostel–Sachs system. The .mat files MATLAB produces are further read by Python with the help of SciPy, which accomplishes the interface between two programming languages.</description>
