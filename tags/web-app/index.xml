      <description>This is a fast and interactive map web app for Berkeley, CA. Features include rastering, labeling, auto-completion and navigation.
 Location nodes are stored in a K-D Tree to quickly find their nearest street point. Auto-completion of the search field is supported by a prefix Trie of all the location names. Navigation depends on A* search using a binary Heap as Priority Queue. Route directions are computed from relative bearing based on haversine distance.</description>
